### installation
- `bower install`
- download voodoojs into lib/ from voodoojs.com and copy it to lib folder, until it's available from bower
- on Mac you might need to give 777 rights to voodoo
- configure your server to serve the index.html, as ColladaLoader doesn't seem to work with file:// protocol
